---

## Phase Summary

### Phase 1: Foundation (Complete)

Migrated core user-facing documentation from `README.md`, `/cli/commands`, and `/profiles/overview`.

| Source | Destination |
|--------|-------------|
| `README.md` | `getting-started/introduction`, `installation`, `quick-start` |
| `/cli/commands` (core) | `cli/commands`, `cli/init`, `cli/add`, `cli/registry`, `cli/profile`, `cli/opencode` |
| `/profiles/overview` | `profiles/overview`, `profiles/configuration`, `profiles/security` |

### Phase 2: Core Ecosystem (Complete)

Migrated enterprise and security documentation with maintainer-only migration notes.

| Source | Destination |
|--------|-------------|
| `/enterprise/overview` | `enterprise/overview` |
| `SECURITY.md` | `security/policy`, `security/verification` |
| `/maintainers/migration-v1-4-0` | `maintainers/migration-v1-4-0` (hidden) |

### Phase 3: Full CLI, Reference, Registries, Guides, Ecosystem (Complete)

Comprehensive migration splitting monolithic documents into focused pages. Added integrations from facade packages and worker profiles.

| Section | Pages |
|---------|-------|
| CLI | `cli/remove`, `cli/update`, `cli/search`, `cli/verify`, `cli/build`, `cli/self`, `cli/config` |
| Reference | `reference/opencode`, `reference/plugins`, `reference/configuration`, `reference/agents`, `reference/skills`, `reference/tools`, `reference/mcp`, `reference/permissions` |
| Registries | `registries/create`, `registries/protocol` |
| Guides | `guides/index`, `guides/oh-my-opencode`, `guides/kdco-workspace` |
| Integrations | `integrations/workspace`, `integrations/background-agents`, `integrations/notify`, `integrations/worktree` |
| Profiles | `profiles/ws`, `profiles/omo` |
| Maintainers | `maintainers/kdco-registry`, `maintainers/ocx-kit` (hidden) |

### Phase 4: QA, Link Validation & Migration Artifacts (Complete)

Delivered comprehensive quality assurance:

- **100% link health:** 0 broken internal links across 44 pages
- **100% command validation:** All 97 CLI snippets verified against source documentation
- **Consistency audit:** Flag naming, config keys, terminology standardized
- **Search optimization:** 45 user intents mapped to primary pages

### Phase 5: Remaining Maintainer Docs (Pending)

One internal documentation page remains unmigrated:

| Source | Target | Rationale for Deferral |
|--------|--------|------------------------|
| `docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md` | `maintainers/manual-testing` | Internal process docs; no external user impact |

## Delivered Artifacts

### Migration Documentation

| Artifact | Location | Purpose |
|----------|----------|---------|
| Source-Target Map | [`source-target-map.md`](./source-target-map.md) | Complete mapping of all source files to Mintlify destinations |
| Link Validation Report | [`link-report.md`](./link-report.md) | Internal link health validation results |
| Consistency Report | [`consistency-report.md`](./consistency-report.md) | Terminology, flag, and config key consistency audit |
| Command Validation Report | [`command-validation-report.md`](./command-validation-report.md) | CLI snippet accuracy verification |
| Search Check Report | [`search-check-report.md`](./search-check-report.md) | User intent mapping and search optimization |
| Redirect Map | [`redirect-map.md`](./redirect-map.md) | Legacy-to-new URL mappings |
| URL Policy | [`url-policy.md`](./url-policy.md) | Naming conventions and URL standards |
| Visibility Policy | [`visibility-policy.md`](./visibility-policy.md) | Public vs. maintainer content classification |
| Templates | [`templates.md`](./templates.md) | Standard page templates (Concept, Task, Command Reference) |
| Mintlify Baseline | [`mintlify-baseline.md`](./mintlify-baseline.md) | Environment setup and quality gates |

### Configuration

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| [`mint.json`](../mint.json) | Mintlify configuration, navigation structure, and 11 legacy redirects |

---

## Quality Metrics

| Metric | Result | Target |
|--------|--------|--------|
| Pages migrated | 44/45 (97.8%) | 45 in-scope migration pages |
| Broken internal links | 0 | 0 |
| Broken anchor links | 0 | 0 |
| Command snippets validated | 97/97 (100%) | 100% |
| Pages with valid frontmatter | 44/44 (100%) | 100% |
| Template compliance | 100% | 100% |
| Code block language tags | 100% | 100% |
| Redirects configured | 11 | 11 |

---

## Deferred Items

### Phase 5: Maintainer Documentation (Non-blocking)

| Item | Status | Rationale |
|------|--------|-----------|
| `docs/MANUAL_TESTING.md` | Pending | Internal testing procedures; zero external user impact |

**Impact:** None. This page is classified as maintainer-only visibility and is not linked from public navigation. It can be migrated post-launch without breaking any user workflows.

### Intentionally Excluded

| Item | Rationale |
|------|-----------|
| `examples/registry-starter/README.md` | Self-contained template designed for GitHub discoverability; content covered by `registries/create` guide |

---

## Readiness Checklist

### Pre-Launch Verification

- [x] All public-facing pages migrated (44/44)
- [x] Navigation structure validated in `mint.json`
- [x] All internal links resolve (0 broken)
- [x] All redirects configured for legacy URLs
- [x] Consistency audit passed
- [x] Command validation passed (97/97)
- [x] Frontmatter present on all pages (100%)
- [x] Template compliance verified
- [x] Hidden navigation configured for maintainer pages
- [ ] Search indexing completed (Mintlify auto-indexes on deployment)
- [ ] Stakeholder sign-off received

### Post-Launch Monitoring

- [ ] Verify all 11 redirects function in production
- [ ] Confirm search results map to expected pages per [`search-check-report.md`](./search-check-report.md)
- [ ] Monitor for 404 errors on legacy URLs
- [ ] Validate Algolia search indexing completes (typically 5–15 minutes post-deploy)

---

## Risk Assessment

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Search indexing delay | Medium | Low | Algolia auto-indexes; monitor for 15 minutes post-deploy |
| Redirect edge cases | Low | Medium | All 11 redirects tested; 301 permanent configured |
| Phase 5 docs needed pre-launch | Low | Low | Internal-only; can be added post-launch without disruption |

---

## Conclusion

The OCX documentation migration meets all quality gates for public launch. Phases 1–4 are complete with 44 pages migrated, validated, and ready for deployment. Phase 5 (1 maintainer-only page) is deferred and does not impact user experience.

**Recommendation:** Proceed with production deployment. The migration is ready for cutover.
