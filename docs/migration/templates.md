## Style and Tone Constraints

### Voice Guidelines

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Use "you" to address the reader | Use "we" or "the user" |
| Write in present tense | Use future or past tense |
| Be specific and concrete | Use vague qualifiers ("very", "really") |
| Lead with the benefit | Lead with the feature name |
| Use active voice | Use passive voice |

### Terminology Standards

Use these terms consistently:

| Term | Meaning | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Profile | User configuration for OpenCode | Not "config" or "settings" |
| Registry | Curated collection of profiles/components | Not "repository" or "store" |
| Component | Installable code snippet or configuration | Not "package" or "module" |
| CLI | Command-line interface | Spell out on first use |
| OCX | The tool itself | Always uppercase |

### Code Example Standards

- Use `bash` for shell commands
- Use `json` for configuration examples
- Use `typescript` for code samples
- Include comments explaining non-obvious parts
- Keep examples copy-paste ready
- Use realistic values (not `foo`, `bar`, `example.com`)

### Formatting Rules

- **Bold** for UI elements and important terms
- `code` for commands, filenames, and inline code
- [Links](/path) for internal references (use site-root paths starting with `/`)
- Tables for structured comparisons
- Bullet lists for unordered items
- Numbered lists for sequential steps

### Frontmatter Requirements

Every page must include:

```yaml
---
title: "Page Title in Title Case"
description: "SEO description under 160 characters"
---
```

Optional frontmatter:

```yaml
---
title: "Page Title"
description: "Description"
icon: "terminal"        # For navigation icons
sidebarTitle: "Short"   # If title is too long for sidebar
---
```

### Accessibility Considerations

- Alt text for all images: `![Descriptive text](path)`
- Table headers clearly describe content
- Code blocks have language specified
- Link text is descriptive (not "click here")
- Heading hierarchy is maintained (no skipping levels)

### Review Checklist

Before submitting any documentation page:

- [ ] Follows appropriate template structure
- [ ] Title case used for titles (AP style)
- [ ] No spelling or grammar errors
- [ ] All code examples tested and working
- [ ] All internal links are valid
- [ ] Images have alt text
- [ ] Tables have headers
- [ ] Tone is consistent with other pages
- [ ] Terminology matches standards
