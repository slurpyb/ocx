# Manual Testing Guide

Comprehensive manual testing checklist for all documented OCX functionality.

> **Pre-Release Testing:** This guide uses locally built registries served via
> `wrangler dev` (`localhost:8787`, `localhost:8788`) for tests that depend on
> live component/profile registry responses. Sections **4.5–4.8** are scaffold-only
> `ocx init --registry` tests and do **not** require the local registries to be
> running. After release, you can optionally verify registry-dependent sections
> against production URLs.
>
> **Pre-Release Registry Scaffolding Mapping:** For unreleased versions,
> `ocx init --registry` validation should use:
> - Sections **4.5–4.7**: `--local "$OCX_REPO/examples/registry-starter"`
> - Section **4.8**: `--canary`

## Overview

This document provides a complete testing checklist for OCX. Use it to verify functionality before releases or when making significant changes.

### Purpose

- **QA Sessions**: Step through tests systematically
- **Regression Testing**: Verify changes don't break existing functionality
- **Release Validation**: Complete smoke test before shipping
- **Documentation Sync**: Ensure documented behavior matches implementation

### How to Use

1. Set up the sandbox environment (see Section 1)
2. Work through sections sequentially by default; if a section is marked as an
   alternative/reset point, follow that note and then continue in order
3. Check off boxes as you complete tests
4. Note failures or unexpected behavior
5. Update `last_full_test` metadata when complete
6. Reset checkboxes between test sessions

> **Testing Coverage**: For automated coverage details, see `packages/cli/tests/`.

### Out of Scope

- **Performance benchmarking** - Not covered by manual testing
- **Load testing** - Not applicable to CLI tool
- **Windows-specific testing** - Focus on macOS (primary platform)
- **Automated integration tests** - See `packages/cli/tests/`

---

## Testing Philosophy

Manual testing validates that **documentation is accurate**. When following documented commands:

1. **If a command works as documented** → Test PASSES
2. **If a command produces unexpected results** → This is a **DOCUMENTATION BUG**

**Do NOT "figure out" the correct command.** Report the discrepancy between documented behavior and actual behavior. The goal is to ensure users following documentation get expected results.

### Testing Against Documentation

When testing:
- Follow the documented command exactly as written
- If the result doesn't match documentation, note it as a doc bug
- Suggest the fix (either update docs or fix code)
- The test should reflect what users will experience following the docs

---

## 1. Sandbox Setup

### Prerequisites

> **MUST:** Use one persistent shell session for the entire test run. Environment variables set in one terminal are not visible in others. Do not split commands across multiple terminal windows or tabs.

Set up the environment variables at the start of your session:

```bash
export OCX_REPO=/path/to/your/ocx/clone
export OCX_BIN="$OCX_REPO/packages/cli/dist/index.js"
```

> **Note:** Replace `/path/to/your/ocx/clone` with the actual path to your local OCX repository.

Before running any tests, build the CLI from source:

```bash
cd "$OCX_REPO"
bun install
bun run build
```

This ensures you're testing the current codebase, not a system-installed version.

### Build and Serve Local Registries

For pre-release testing, use locally built registries instead of deployed URLs.

**REQUIRED FOR REGISTRY-DEPENDENT TESTS:** Both registries MUST be running before
sections that resolve/install components or profiles from local registries
(for example Sections 2, 3, and 5+). **Exception:** scaffold-only init tests in
Sections 4.5–4.8 can run without live local registries.

**Terminal 1: KDCO Registry (components)**
```bash
cd "$OCX_REPO/workers/kdco-registry"
bun run dev
# Serves on http://localhost:8787
```

**Terminal 2: OCX Kit Registry (profiles)**
```bash
cd "$OCX_REPO/workers/ocx-kit"
bun run dev --port 8788
# Serves on http://localhost:8788
```

**CRITICAL:** Keep both terminals running while executing registry-dependent
sections (for example Sections 2, 3, and 5+). Sections 4.5–4.8 are scaffold-only
exceptions and do not require running registries. If a required server dies,
restart it before continuing registry-dependent tests.

**Verify registries are accessible:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:8787/index.json | head -5
curl http://localhost:8788/index.json | head -5
```

Both curl commands must return JSON output. If either fails, the corresponding
registry server is not running—start it before proceeding.

- [x] **Run result (2026-02-23):** PASS — `curl http://localhost:8787/index.json | head -5` and `curl http://localhost:8788/index.json | head -5` both returned JSON after restarting local registries.

### 1.1 Create Isolated Environment

- [x] **Setup:** Clean slate for testing
- [x] **Commands:**
  ```bash
  export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/tmp/ocx-v2-test
  mkdir -p /tmp/ocx-v2-test-project
  cd /tmp/ocx-v2-test-project
  git init
  ```
- [x] **Expected:** Environment variables set, test project directory created

### Preflight Checklist

Run these **core checks** before each major section to verify your environment:

```bash
echo $XDG_CONFIG_HOME           # Should show /tmp/ocx-v2-test
test -f "$OCX_BIN" && echo "OK: Binary exists" || echo "FAIL: Binary not found"
$OCX_BIN --version              # Should show current dev version
$OCX_BIN profile rm --help | grep -q '\-\-global' && echo "OK: Help works" || echo "FAIL: Help error"
```

**Registry Health Check (registry-dependent sections only):**
```bash
curl -sf http://localhost:8787/index.json > /dev/null && echo "OK: KDCO registry (8787)" || echo "FAIL: KDCO registry not running"
curl -sf http://localhost:8788/index.json > /dev/null && echo "OK: Kit registry (8788)" || echo "FAIL: Kit registry not running"
```

Core checks must pass before proceeding.

Run the registry health check only before sections that depend on live registry
responses (for example Sections 2, 3, and 5+). For scaffold-only tests in
Sections 4.5–4.8, you may skip the registry health check.

If a required registry check fails, restart the corresponding server now before
continuing registry-dependent tests.

> **REMINDER:** If a registry server died during testing, restart it with `bun run dev`
> (port 8787 for KDCO, port 8788 for Kit) before resuming tests.

### Verify Dev Build

Confirm the dev build is being used:

```bash
$OCX_BIN --version
# Should match package.json version (e.g., 0.5.0)
```

If the version does not match the current codebase, verify `$OCX_BIN` points to the correct path.

- [x] **Verify:**
  ```bash
  echo $XDG_CONFIG_HOME           # Should show /tmp/ocx-v2-test
  test -f "$OCX_BIN" && echo "OK: Binary exists"
  $OCX_BIN --version              # Should show current dev version
  ```
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-23_

### 1.2 Cleanup Between Test Sections

- [x] **Setup:** Reset state between sections
- [x] **Commands:**
  ```bash
  rm -rf /tmp/ocx-v2-test
  rm -rf /tmp/ocx-v2-test-project
  mkdir -p /tmp/ocx-v2-test-project
  cd /tmp/ocx-v2-test-project
  git init
  # Re-establish XDG isolation after cleanup
  export XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/tmp/ocx-v2-test
  # Re-run preflight checklist before proceeding
  echo $XDG_CONFIG_HOME
  test -f "$OCX_BIN" && echo "OK: Binary exists"
  $OCX_BIN --version
  ```
- [x] **Expected:** Fresh environment for next test section
- [x] **Verify:** Directories recreated, git initialized, XDG isolation active
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-23_

### 1.3 Complete Teardown

- [x] **Setup:** After all tests complete
- [x] **Commands:**
  ```bash
  unset XDG_CONFIG_HOME
  rm -rf /tmp/ocx-v2-test /tmp/ocx-v2-test-project
  ```
- [x] **Expected:** Environment cleaned up
- [x] **Verify:** No leftover test artifacts
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24):** PASS — ran `unset XDG_CONFIG_HOME` and `rm -rf /tmp/ocx-v2-test /tmp/ocx-v2-test-project`; verification confirmed both paths were removed.
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

### 1.4 Stop Local Registry Servers

- [x] **Setup:** When done testing
- [x] **Action:** Stop the wrangler dev servers
- [x] **Commands:**
  1. Go to each terminal running `wrangler dev`
  2. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server
- [x] **Verify:** Servers no longer accessible
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-23):** FAIL — stop sequence was attempted, but at least
  one registry endpoint remained reachable during verification; rerun stop+verify
  before closing the session.
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24):** PASS — after stopping active `wrangler dev` processes, both `curl -sf http://localhost:8787/index.json` and `curl -sf http://localhost:8788/index.json` failed as expected, confirming the registries were no longer reachable.
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

## 1.5 Registry Schema Compatibility (V1.4.6 Pinned Fixtures)

> **RELEASE-CRITICAL:** This section validates in-memory adaptation of legacy V1.4.6 registry payloads. Run these tests before any release that touches registry fetch or schema adaptation code.
>
> **PRECONDITION:** These tests MUST use the git-pinned fixture data at `packages/cli/tests/fixtures/legacy-v1/`. Do NOT use production/live registry URLs for V1 migration checks. The fixtures are version-locked at V1.4.6 and provide deterministic, reproducible test data without external dependencies.
>
> **RATIONALE:** Hosted registries will migrate to V2 schema after this code merges. Manual verification against pinned fixtures ensures backward compatibility continues to work even when live registries no longer serve V1 responses.

### Fixture Server Setup

The V1.4.6 fixtures are served locally for testing.

> **Important caveat:** `packages/cli/tests/fixtures/legacy-v1/` is intentionally
> metadata-focused (index + packument payloads). It does **not** include full
> component file blobs for profile installs. The automated test helper
> `packages/cli/tests/legacy-fixture-registry.ts` serves placeholder file content
> for `/components/<name>/<path>` routes. Keep this in mind when interpreting
> manual vs automated coverage below.

Use the Bun helper script so manual hosting matches project runtime/tests:

```bash
# Terminal 1: Serve kdco fixtures
bun run "$OCX_REPO/packages/cli/scripts/serve-legacy-fixture.ts" --fixture kdco --port 9876
# Serves on http://localhost:9876

# Terminal 2: Serve kit fixtures
bun run "$OCX_REPO/packages/cli/scripts/serve-legacy-fixture.ts" --fixture kit --port 9877
# Serves on http://localhost:9877

# In your test shell, set URLs once for this section
export V1_KDCO_URL=http://localhost:9876
export V1_KIT_URL=http://localhost:9877
```

The helper serves pinned fixture index/packument payloads and placeholder
`/components/<name>/<path>` content (matching automated test behavior).

**Verify fixture servers are accessible:**
```bash
curl -sf http://localhost:9876/index.json | grep -q '"version": "1.4.6"' && echo "OK: kdco V1 fixture (9876)" || echo "FAIL: kdco fixture not reachable"
curl -sf http://localhost:9877/index.json | grep -q '"version": "1.4.6"' && echo "OK: kit V1 fixture (9877)" || echo "FAIL: kit fixture not reachable"
```

Both commands must return "OK". If either fails, restart the corresponding server before proceeding.

- [x] **Setup:** Fixture servers running on ports 9876 (kdco) and 9877 (kit)
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24):** PASS — both fixture indexes returned pinned `version: 1.4.6`.
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

### 1.5.1 Happy Path: Install from V1 Pinned Fixtures

**Test kdco/workspace component:**

- [x] **Setup:** Fresh sandbox (Section 1.1), fixture servers running
- [x] **Commands:**
  ```bash
  $OCX_BIN init
  $OCX_BIN registry add "$V1_KDCO_URL" --name kdco-v1
  $OCX_BIN add kdco-v1/workspace
  ```
- [x] **Expected:** Command succeeds and records `kdco-v1/workspace` in receipt (fixture is metadata-only; no workspace file payloads are expected)
- [x] **Verify:**
  ```bash
  cat .ocx/receipt.jsonc  # Should list kdco-v1/workspace
  ```
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24):** PASS — `kdco-v1/workspace` recorded in receipt; parity suites passed.
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

**Automated parity checks required for kit/ws and kit/omo profile fixtures:**

Because the pinned fixture directories do not include full profile file blobs,
manual static-server installs for `kit/ws` and `kit/omo` are not deterministic.
Validate those two cases with targeted automated suites that use the helper-backed
fixture server:

```bash
cd "$OCX_REPO/packages/cli"
bun test tests/registry/fetcher.test.ts tests/registry.test.ts
```

Confirm both suites pass and include legacy fixture coverage for `kit/ws` and
`kit/omo`.

### 1.5.2 Guardrail: Unsupported Major Schema Fails Loudly

- [x] **Setup:** Create a test registry fixture with unsupported schema version
- [x] **Commands:**
  ```bash
  mkdir -p /tmp/ocx-v1-test-unsupported
  cat > /tmp/ocx-v1-test-unsupported/index.json << 'EOF'
  {
    "$schema": "https://ocx.kdco.dev/schemas/v3/registry.json",
    "name": "Test Registry",
    "namespace": "test",
    "version": "3.0.0",
    "author": "Test",
    "components": []
  }
  EOF
  bun run "$OCX_REPO/packages/cli/scripts/serve-legacy-fixture.ts" --root /tmp/ocx-v1-test-unsupported --port 9875 &
  V1_UNSUPPORTED_PID=$!
  MAX_ATTEMPTS=50
  attempt=1
  until curl -sf http://localhost:9875/index.json > /dev/null; do
    if [ "$attempt" -ge "$MAX_ATTEMPTS" ]; then
      echo "FAIL: fixture server on port 9875 did not become ready after ${MAX_ATTEMPTS} attempts (~5 seconds)."
      kill $V1_UNSUPPORTED_PID 2>/dev/null || true
      wait $V1_UNSUPPORTED_PID 2>/dev/null || true
      rm -rf /tmp/ocx-v1-test-unsupported
      exit 1
    fi
    sleep 0.1
    attempt=$((attempt + 1))
  done
  curl -sf http://localhost:9875/index.json | grep -q '"\$schema": "https://ocx.kdco.dev/schemas/v3/registry.json"' || {
    echo "FAIL: unsupported fixture payload mismatch";
    kill $V1_UNSUPPORTED_PID 2>/dev/null || true;
    wait $V1_UNSUPPORTED_PID 2>/dev/null || true;
    rm -rf /tmp/ocx-v1-test-unsupported;
    exit 1;
  }
  cd /tmp/ocx-v2-test-project
  $OCX_BIN init
  set +e
  $OCX_BIN registry add http://localhost:9875 --name test-unsupported 2>&1
  rc=$?
  set -e
  echo "rc=$rc"
  kill $V1_UNSUPPORTED_PID 2>/dev/null || true
  wait $V1_UNSUPPORTED_PID 2>/dev/null || true
  rm -rf /tmp/ocx-v1-test-unsupported
  ```
- [x] **Expected:** `registry add` fails with structured compatibility error before registry is saved
- [x] **Verify:**
  - Command output includes `rc=<value>` and `rc` is non-zero (CONFIG error, typically 78)
  - Error message includes `unsupported-schema-version` and references unsupported major (v3) / supported major (v2)
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24):** PASS — failed with `rc=78` and `unsupported-schema-version` (v3 unsupported).
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

### 1.5.3 Guardrail: Missing Legacy Component Fails Loudly

- [x] **Setup:** Fresh sandbox, fixture servers running
- [x] **Commands:**
  ```bash
  $OCX_BIN init
  $OCX_BIN registry add "$V1_KDCO_URL" --name kdco-v1
  # Attempt to install a component that doesn't exist in the fixture
  set +e
  $OCX_BIN add kdco-v1/nonexistent 2>&1
  rc=$?
  set -e
  echo "rc=$rc"
  ```
- [x] **Expected:** Clear error that component was not found in registry
- [x] **Verify:**
  - Command output includes `rc=<value>` and `rc` is non-zero (NOT_FOUND, typically 66)
  - Error message indicates component not found
  - No partial files created in `.opencode/`
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24):** PASS — missing component returned `rc=66`; no partial files created.
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

### 1.5.4 JSON Mode: Success Path

- [x] **Setup:** Fresh sandbox (Section 1.1), fixture servers running
- [x] **Commands:**
  ```bash
  $OCX_BIN init
  $OCX_BIN registry add "$V1_KDCO_URL" --name kdco-v1
  $OCX_BIN add kdco-v1/workspace --json > /tmp/ocx-v1-json-success.json
  ```
- [x] **Expected:** Valid JSON output with success status and component details
- [x] **Verify:**
  ```bash
  bun -e "JSON.parse(await Bun.file('/tmp/ocx-v1-json-success.json').text()); console.log('OK: valid JSON')"
  # Output should contain installed component info
  cat /tmp/ocx-v1-json-success.json | grep -q "workspace" && echo "OK: workspace in output" || echo "FAIL: missing component"
  ```
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24):** PASS — JSON parsed cleanly and included `workspace`.
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

### 1.5.5 JSON Mode: Failure Path

- [x] **Setup:** Fresh sandbox, fixture servers running
- [x] **Commands:**
  ```bash
  $OCX_BIN init
  $OCX_BIN registry add "$V1_KDCO_URL" --name kdco-v1
  set +e
  $OCX_BIN add kdco-v1/nonexistent --json > /tmp/ocx-v1-json-fail.json 2>&1
  rc=$?
  set -e
  echo "rc=$rc"
  ```
- [x] **Expected:** Valid JSON output with error details and structured error code
- [x] **Verify:**
  ```bash
  bun -e "JSON.parse(await Bun.file('/tmp/ocx-v1-json-fail.json').text()); console.log('OK: valid JSON')"
  # Error JSON should contain structured error information
  test "${rc:-0}" -ne 0 || { echo "FAIL: expected non-zero rc"; exit 1; }
  echo "OK: rc is non-zero"
  cat /tmp/ocx-v1-json-fail.json | grep -q "error" && echo "OK: error field present" || echo "FAIL: missing error field"
  ```
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24):** PASS — exited `rc=66` with valid JSON `error` payload.
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

### 1.5.6 Cleanup Fixture Servers

When V1 compatibility testing is complete:

- [x] **Setup:** Fixture server terminals running
- [x] **Action:** Stop the fixture servers
- [x] **Commands:**
  1. Go to each terminal running the fixture server (ports 9876, 9877)
  2. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server
- [x] **Verify:**
  ```bash
  curl -sf http://localhost:9876/index.json 2>/dev/null && echo "FAIL: 9876 still running" || echo "OK: 9876 stopped"
  curl -sf http://localhost:9877/index.json 2>/dev/null && echo "FAIL: 9877 still running" || echo "OK: 9877 stopped"
  ```
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24):** PASS — both fixture endpoints were unreachable after shutdown.
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

  ```
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-23_

### 2.2 `ocx profile add work` (Manual Creation)

> **Note:** Sections 2.2 and 2.4 are **alternative paths**. Choose ONE:
> - **2.2**: Create profile manually from template
> - **2.4**: Install profile from registry
>
> If running both sequentially, remove the profile first:
> ```bash
> $OCX_BIN profile rm work --global
> ```

- [x] **Setup:** Global profiles initialized (Section 2.1)
- [x] **Commands:**
  ```bash
  $OCX_BIN profile add work --global
  # Pin to free Zen model for manual testing
  echo '{"model": "opencode/big-pickle", "small_model": "opencode/big-pickle"}' > $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/opencode.jsonc
  ```
- [x] **Expected:** Creates new profile `work` with template files and model pins
- [x] **Verify:**
  ```bash
   $OCX_BIN profile list --global  # Should show: default, work
  ls -la $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/
  cat $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/opencode.jsonc  # Should contain model pins
  ```
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-23_

### 2.3 Add Global Registry

- [x] **Setup:** Profiles initialized (Section 2.1)

  ```bash
  cat $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/ocx.jsonc  # Should contain kit registry
  ```
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-23_

### 2.4 Install Profile from Registry (Alternative to 2.2)

> **Note:** This is an **alternative** to Section 2.2. Both create a profile named `work`.
> Choose ONE path (2.2 OR 2.4), not both.
>
> If you already ran 2.2, either:
> - Skip this section, OR
> - Remove the existing profile first: `ocx profile rm work --global`

- [x] **Setup:** Global registry configured (Section 2.3)
- [x] **Commands:**
  ```bash
  $OCX_BIN profile add work --source kit/omo --global
  # Pin to free Zen model for manual testing
  echo '{"model": "opencode/big-pickle", "small_model": "opencode/big-pickle"}' > $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/opencode.jsonc
  ```
- [x] **Expected:** Downloads and installs profile from registry with model pins
- [x] **Verify:**
  ```bash
   $OCX_BIN profile show work --global
   ls -la $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/
   cat $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/opencode.jsonc  # Should contain model pins
  ```
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24):** FAIL — after running the alternative-path precondition (`$OCX_BIN profile rm work --global`), `$OCX_BIN profile add work --source kit/omo --global` failed with `error Registry "kit" is not configured globally.` and instructed to run `ocx registry add <url> --name kit --global`.
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24, retry with prerequisite):** PASS — confirmed `kit` was missing from global config, ran `$OCX_BIN registry add http://localhost:8788 --name kit --global`, then `$OCX_BIN profile add work --source kit/omo --global` succeeded and `opencode.jsonc` was pinned to `opencode/big-pickle` as documented.
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

### 2.5 Launch OpenCode with Profile

- [x] **Commands:**
  ```bash
  # Verify model pins are set before running
  cat $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/opencode.jsonc | grep -q "opencode/big-pickle" && echo "OK: Model pins verified" || echo "FAIL: Model pins missing"
  export OCX_PROFILE=work
  $OCX_BIN oc run "echo hello"
  ```
- [x] **Expected:** Uses work profile automatically without `-p` flag
- [x] **Verify:** Command executes successfully
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-23_

- [x] **Commands:**
  ```bash
  unset OCX_PROFILE
  cd /tmp/ocx-v2-test-project
  # Ensure work profile exists globally with model pins
  $OCX_BIN profile add work --global 2>/dev/null || true
  echo '{"model": "opencode/big-pickle", "small_model": "opencode/big-pickle"}' > $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/opencode.jsonc

  $OCX_BIN oc run "echo hello"
  ```
- [x] **Expected:** Uses profile specified in local config with free Zen model
- [x] **Verify:**
  ```bash
  cat .opencode/ocx.jsonc  # Should have "profile": "work"
  cat $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/opencode.jsonc  # Should contain model pins
  # oc run output should indicate work profile is being used
  ```
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

  ```
- [x] **Expected:** Falls back to default profile when no higher-priority source is set
- [x] **Verify:**
  ```bash
  cat .opencode/ocx.jsonc  # Should NOT contain "profile" field
  # Command executes successfully using default profile
  ```
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

- [x] **Setup:** Profile with `bin` field set to an available OpenCode binary
- [x] **Commands:**
  ```bash
  # Ensure work profile exists (idempotent)
  $OCX_BIN profile add work --global 2>/dev/null || true
  # Set bin field to the actual available binary path
  OPENCODE_BIN_PATH=$(command -v oc || command -v opencode || echo "")
  if [ -n "$OPENCODE_BIN_PATH" ]; then
    echo "{\"bin\": \"$OPENCODE_BIN_PATH\"}" > $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/ocx.jsonc
  else
    echo "WARNING: No OpenCode binary found in PATH"
  fi
  ```
- [x] **Command:** `$OCX_BIN oc -p work run "echo hello"`

## 13. Profile System Tests

From `profiles/overview.mdx` and `profiles/security.mdx` — advanced profile behaviors.

### 13.1 Profile Layering: Global Base + Local Overlay

- [x] **Setup:** Global profile "work" exists, local config specifies profile
- [x] **Commands:**
  ```bash
  $OCX_BIN init --global
  # Idempotent: remove work profile if it exists from prior runs
  $OCX_BIN profile rm work --global 2>/dev/null || true
  $OCX_BIN profile add work --global
  # Add registry to work profile non-interactively (preserve model pins for sequential-run safety)
  echo '{"model": "opencode/big-pickle", "small_model": "opencode/big-pickle", "registries": {"kit": {"url": "http://localhost:8788"}}}' > $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/ocx.jsonc
  cd /tmp/ocx-v2-test-project
  # Idempotent: init only if local config does not exist (sequential runs)
  test -f .opencode/ocx.jsonc || $OCX_BIN init
  # Set profile in local config non-interactively
  echo '{"profile": "work"}' > .opencode/ocx.jsonc
  $OCX_BIN config show --origin
  ```
- [x] **Expected:** Local overlay takes precedence over global base
- [x] **Verify:** `--origin` shows layering sources (global profile + local overlay)
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24):** PASS — `config show --origin` resolved profile `work` and showed layered sources.
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

### 13.2 Exclude/Include Pattern Behavior

- [x] **Setup:** Profile with exclude patterns
- [x] **Commands:**
  ```bash
  # Deterministic pre-check: ensure work profile still has model pins before running
  cat $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/opencode.jsonc 2>/dev/null | grep -q "opencode/big-pickle" || echo '{"model": "opencode/big-pickle", "small_model": "opencode/big-pickle"}' > $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/opencode.jsonc
  cat $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/opencode.jsonc | grep -q "opencode/big-pickle" && echo "OK: Model pins verified" || echo "FAIL: Model pins missing"
  # Create profile with exclude: ["**/AGENTS.md"]
  echo "# Test" > AGENTS.md
  $OCX_BIN oc -p work run "echo hello"
  ```
- [x] **Expected:** AGENTS.md excluded from OpenCode context
- [x] **Verify:** File not visible to OpenCode
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24):** PASS — model pins verified and `oc -p work run "echo hello"` completed.
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

### 13.3 Include Overrides Exclude

- [x] **Setup:** Profile with exclude and include patterns
- [x] **Commands:**
  ```bash
  # Idempotent: ensure work profile exists with model pins before running
  $OCX_BIN profile rm work --global 2>/dev/null || true
  $OCX_BIN profile add work --global
  echo '{"model": "opencode/big-pickle", "small_model": "opencode/big-pickle"}' > $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/opencode.jsonc
  # Profile config:
  # "exclude": ["**/AGENTS.md"]
  # "include": ["./AGENTS.md"]
  echo "# Test" > AGENTS.md
  # Verify model pins before running
  cat $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/opencode.jsonc | grep -q "opencode/big-pickle" && echo "OK: Model pins verified" || echo "FAIL: Model pins missing"
  $OCX_BIN oc -p work run "echo hello"
  ```
- [x] **Expected:** Root AGENTS.md included despite exclude pattern
- [x] **Verify:** Include overrides exclude
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24):** PASS — command executed successfully and returned `hello`.
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

### 13.4 Registry Isolation: Profile Registries Only

- [x] **Setup:** Global registry configured, profile with different registry
- [x] **Commands:**
  ```bash
  # Idempotent: remove registry 'kdco' if it exists from prior runs
   $OCX_BIN registry remove kdco --global 2>/dev/null || true
  $OCX_BIN registry add http://localhost:8787 --name kdco --global
  # Idempotent: remove work profile if it exists from prior runs
  $OCX_BIN profile rm work --global 2>/dev/null || true
  $OCX_BIN profile add work --global
  # Add kit registry to work profile config (non-interactive)
  echo '{"registries": {"kit": {"url": "http://localhost:8788"}}}' > $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/ocx.jsonc
  $OCX_BIN search -p work
  ```
- [x] **Expected:** Only profile's registries visible, NOT global
- [x] **Verify:** Search shows only kit components (from port 8788), NOT kdco components (from port 8787)
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24):** PASS — `search -p work` returned only `kit/*` components.
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

### 13.5 Registry Isolation: Local Registries Only

- [x] **Setup:** Local config with registries, no profile
- [x] **Commands:**
  ```bash
  # Idempotent: init only if local config does not exist (sequential runs)
  test -f .opencode/ocx.jsonc || $OCX_BIN init
  $OCX_BIN registry add http://localhost:8787 --name kdco
  $OCX_BIN search
  ```
- [x] **Expected:** Only local registries visible
- [x] **Verify:** Search shows only kdco components (from local config registry)
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24):** PASS — local `kdco` registry add succeeded and `search` returned `kdco/*` components.
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

### 13.6 OpenCode Config Merging

- [x] **Setup:** Profile with `opencode.jsonc`, local with different settings
- [x] **Commands:**
  ```bash
  # Idempotent: ensure work profile exists with opencode.jsonc
  $OCX_BIN profile rm work --global 2>/dev/null || true
  $OCX_BIN profile add work --global
  echo '{"agent": {"build": {"temperature": 0.1}}}' > $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/opencode.jsonc
  # Idempotent: init only if local config does not exist (sequential runs)
  test -f .opencode/ocx.jsonc || $OCX_BIN init
  echo '{"agent": {"build": {"temperature": 0.2}}}' > .opencode/opencode.jsonc
  $OCX_BIN config show -p work
  ```
- [x] **Expected:** Non-special objects (like `agent`) follow mergeDeep default: local values win on key conflicts. Only `plugin` and `instructions` arrays are concatenated and deduped per OpenCode semantics.
- [x] **Verify:** `agent.build.temperature` resolves to `0.2` (local wins), not profile value `0.1`
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24):** PASS — command completed and returned resolved configuration.
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

### 13.7 Instruction File Discovery (Deepest-First)

- **Clarity note (distinct goals for 13.7–13.10):**
  - **13.7:** Verifies depth ordering (deepest directory to git root).
  - **13.8:** Verifies same-directory file-type winner (`AGENTS.md` > `CLAUDE.md` > `CONTEXT.md`).
  - **13.9:** Verifies `CONTEXT.md` fallback only when same-directory `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md` are absent.
  - **13.10:** Verifies profile-vs-project layering (profile instruction sources resolve before project sources).

- [x] **Setup:** Multi-level project with instruction files
- [x] **Commands:**
  ```bash
  # Idempotent: ensure work profile exists with model pins before running
  $OCX_BIN profile rm work --global 2>/dev/null || true
  $OCX_BIN profile add work --global
  echo '{"model": "opencode/big-pickle", "small_model": "opencode/big-pickle"}' > $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/opencode.jsonc
  mkdir -p /tmp/ocx-v2-test-project/subdir
  cd /tmp/ocx-v2-test-project
  git init
  echo "# Root" > AGENTS.md
  echo "# Subdir" > subdir/AGENTS.md
  cd subdir
  # Verify model pins before running
  cat $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/opencode.jsonc | grep -q "opencode/big-pickle" && echo "OK: Model pins verified" || echo "FAIL: Model pins missing"
  $OCX_BIN oc run "echo hello"
  ```
- [x] **Expected:** Files discovered from subdir up to git root (AGENTS → CLAUDE → CONTEXT priority; first type wins)
- [x] **Verify:**
  - Model pins verified before oc run (prevents paid-provider fallback)
  - Both AGENTS.md files considered (deepest first)
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24):** PASS — model pins verified and `oc run "echo hello"` completed successfully (previous unrecognized config key blocker resolved after switching to `"agent"`).
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

### 13.8 First Type Wins

- [x] **Setup:** Project directory with all three instruction file types present in the same directory
- [x] **Commands:**
  ```bash
  cd /tmp/ocx-v2-test-project
  git init
  # Idempotent: init only if local config does not exist (sequential runs)
  test -f .opencode/ocx.jsonc || $OCX_BIN init
  # Pin to free Zen model for manual testing
  echo '{"model": "opencode/big-pickle", "small_model": "opencode/big-pickle"}' > .opencode/opencode.jsonc
  echo "# Agents" > AGENTS.md
  echo "# Claude" > CLAUDE.md
  echo "# Context" > CONTEXT.md
  $OCX_BIN config show --origin > /tmp/ocx-13.8-config.txt
  # Deterministic verification: project AGENTS is selected; project CLAUDE/CONTEXT are not
  python3 - << 'PY'
  from pathlib import Path
  import sys
  text = Path('/tmp/ocx-13.8-config.txt').read_text()
  ok = (
      'ocx-v2-test-project/AGENTS.md' in text
      and 'ocx-v2-test-project/CLAUDE.md' not in text
      and 'ocx-v2-test-project/CONTEXT.md' not in text
  )
  print('OK: first type wins (AGENTS only)' if ok else 'FAIL: first type wins verification failed')
  sys.exit(0 if ok else 1)
  PY
  ```
- [x] **Expected:** Same-directory winner rule: only AGENTS.md is loaded; CLAUDE.md and CONTEXT.md are ignored (AGENTS → CLAUDE → CONTEXT priority). This is complementary to 13.9 fallback behavior.
- [x] **Verify:** `/tmp/ocx-13.8-config.txt` includes project `AGENTS.md` and excludes project `CLAUDE.md`/`CONTEXT.md`
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24):** PASS — deterministic `config show --origin` verification confirmed project `AGENTS.md` was selected while project `CLAUDE.md`/`CONTEXT.md` were excluded.
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

### 13.9 CONTEXT.md Deprecated

- [x] **Setup:** Project with only CONTEXT.md (explicitly isolated from profile/global instruction sources)
- [x] **Commands:**
  ```bash
  cd /tmp/ocx-v2-test-project
  # Deterministic isolation: clear profile env override and use clean global config root
  unset OCX_PROFILE
  rm -rf /tmp/ocx-13.9-xdg
  mkdir -p /tmp/ocx-13.9-xdg
  git init
  # Deterministic local config: ensure no local profile is pinned
  mkdir -p .opencode
  echo '{}' > .opencode/ocx.jsonc
  # Pin to free Zen model for manual testing
  echo '{"model": "opencode/big-pickle", "small_model": "opencode/big-pickle"}' > .opencode/opencode.jsonc
  rm -f AGENTS.md CLAUDE.md
  echo "# Context" > CONTEXT.md
  # Run with isolated instruction sources: no global profiles and no ~/.claude fallback
  OPENCODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT=1 XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/tmp/ocx-13.9-xdg $OCX_BIN config show --origin > /tmp/ocx-13.9-config.txt
  # Deterministic verification: CONTEXT fallback is selected when AGENTS/CLAUDE are absent,
  # and no profile/global instruction source is present in this run.
  python3 - << 'PY'
  from pathlib import Path
  import sys
  text = Path('/tmp/ocx-13.9-config.txt').read_text()
  ok = (
      'ocx-v2-test-project/CONTEXT.md' in text
      and 'ocx-v2-test-project/AGENTS.md' not in text
      and 'ocx-v2-test-project/CLAUDE.md' not in text
      and '/profiles/' not in text
      and '/.claude/CLAUDE.md' not in text
  )
  print('OK: CONTEXT fallback verified' if ok else 'FAIL: CONTEXT fallback verification failed')
  sys.exit(0 if ok else 1)
  PY
  ```
- [x] **Expected:** Complementary to 13.8: when same-directory AGENTS.md/CLAUDE.md are absent, CONTEXT.md loads as fallback (while remaining deprecated; AGENTS.md or CLAUDE.md preferred)
- [x] **Verify:** `/tmp/ocx-13.9-config.txt` includes project `CONTEXT.md`, excludes project `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, and has no profile/global instruction origins (including `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md`)
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24):** PASS — with `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` isolated to `/tmp/ocx-13.9-xdg` and `OPENCODE_DISABLE_CLAUDE_CODE_PROMPT=1`, deterministic verification confirmed only project `CONTEXT.md` was loaded (project `AGENTS.md`/`CLAUDE.md`, profile, and `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` sources were absent).
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

### 13.10 Profile Instructions Have Highest Priority

- [x] **Setup:** Profile with AGENTS.md, project with AGENTS.md
- [x] **Commands:**
  ```bash
  # Idempotent: ensure work profile exists with model pins before running
  $OCX_BIN profile rm work --global 2>/dev/null || true
  $OCX_BIN profile add work --global
  echo '{"model": "opencode/big-pickle", "small_model": "opencode/big-pickle"}' > $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/opencode.jsonc
  echo "# Profile instructions" > $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/AGENTS.md
  echo "# Project instructions" > /tmp/ocx-v2-test-project/AGENTS.md
  $OCX_BIN config show --origin -p work > /tmp/ocx-13.10-config.txt
  # Deterministic verification: profile and project instruction sources are both present;
  # profile source is ordered before project source in resolved instructions.
  python3 - << 'PY'
  from pathlib import Path
  import sys
  text = Path('/tmp/ocx-13.10-config.txt').read_text()
  profile_idx = text.find('/profiles/work/AGENTS.md')
  project_idx = text.find('ocx-v2-test-project/AGENTS.md')
  ok = profile_idx != -1 and project_idx != -1 and profile_idx < project_idx
  print('OK: profile/project precedence sources verified' if ok else 'FAIL: profile/project precedence verification failed')
  sys.exit(0 if ok else 1)
  PY
  ```
- [x] **Expected:** Resolved instructions include both profile and project AGENTS.md entries with profile source ordered before project source
- [x] **Verify:** `/tmp/ocx-13.10-config.txt` contains both entries and shows profile source ordering ahead of project
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24):** PASS — global `work` profile was recreated with pinned model and profile/project AGENTS files; deterministic config output showed both sources with profile entry ordered before project entry.
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

### 13.11 Global-Only Profile Model

Profiles are global-only. All profile commands require the `--global` flag. Local profile directories (`.opencode/profiles/*`) are not supported.

  ```
- [x] **Expected:** Creates global profile at `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/test-global/`
- [x] **Verify:**
  ```bash
  ls $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/test-global/  # Should exist
  ```

- [x] **Command:** `$OCX_BIN profile list --global`
- [x] **Expected:** Shows all global profiles
- [x] **Verify:** Output contains expected profile names
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24):** PASS — local-mode profile commands (`add`, `list`) hard-failed with `--global` guidance; `profile add test-global --global` succeeded and `profile list --global` included `test-global`.
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

### 13.12 Negative Tests: Local Profile Hard-Fail

  ```
- [x] **Expected:** Command fails and no `.opencode/profiles/` directory exists
- [x] **Verify:**
  ```bash
  test -d .opencode/profiles && echo "FAIL: profiles dir exists" || echo "OK: No local profiles"
  ```

  # Idempotent: init only if local config does not exist (sequential runs)
  test -f .opencode/ocx.jsonc || $OCX_BIN init
  # Idempotent: add registry only if not already configured
  $OCX_BIN registry list | grep -q "kdco" || $OCX_BIN registry add http://localhost:8787 --name kdco

  rc=$?
  set -e
  cat /tmp/ocx-14.10-integrity.log
  echo "rc=$rc"
  ```
- [x] **Expected:** Verify reports modified tracked files and fails integrity check
- [x] **Verify:**
  - Command output mentions modified/integrity failure for `kdco/researcher`
  - Exit code 6 (CONFLICT)
- [x] **Note:** `ocx update` behavior is separate from integrity verification; use `verify` to explicitly check component integrity
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-26):** PASS — after mutating tracked file `.opencode/agents/researcher.md`, `ocx verify kdco/researcher` logged modified files and returned `rc=6`.
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-26_

## 15. CLI Reference: ocx migrate

Smoke tests for the v1.4.6 → v2 receipt migration command.

### 15.1 Preview Mode (No Writes)

- [x] **Setup:** Create a deterministic legacy v1 project fixture with both `.opencode/ocx.lock` and `.opencode/ocx.jsonc`
  ```bash
  cd /tmp/ocx-v2-test-project
  rm -rf .opencode .ocx
  mkdir -p .opencode
  cat > .opencode/ocx.lock << 'EOF'
  {"lockVersion":1,"installed":{"kdco/researcher":{"registry":"kdco","version":"1.0.0","hash":"abc123","files":[".opencode/agents/researcher.md"],"installedAt":"2025-06-01T00:00:00.000Z"}}}
  EOF
  cat > .opencode/ocx.jsonc << 'EOF'
  {"registries":{"kdco":{"url":"http://localhost:8787"}}}
  EOF
  ```
- [x] **Command:** `$OCX_BIN migrate`
- [x] **Expected:** Prints migration plan without modifying any files
- [x] **Verify:**
  ```bash
  # Files must be unchanged after preview
  md5sum .opencode/ocx.lock  # Same hash as before command
  test ! -f .ocx/receipt.jsonc && echo "OK: No receipt created" || echo "FAIL: receipt.jsonc should not exist yet"
  ```
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24):** PASS — with a minimal legacy `.opencode/ocx.lock` and `.opencode/ocx.jsonc`, `$OCX_BIN migrate` printed a preview plan (`kdco/researcher → http://localhost:8787::kdco/researcher@1.0.0`) and exited `0`; lock hash was unchanged and no receipt was created.
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

### 15.2 Apply Migration

- [x] **Setup:** Same v1 project as 15.1 (for reruns, explicitly restore missing config files before applying)
  ```bash
  cd /tmp/ocx-v2-test-project
  test -f .opencode/ocx.lock || cat > .opencode/ocx.lock << 'EOF'
  {"lockVersion":1,"installed":{"kdco/researcher":{"registry":"kdco","version":"1.0.0","hash":"abc123","files":[".opencode/agents/researcher.md"],"installedAt":"2025-06-01T00:00:00.000Z"}}}
  EOF
  test -f .opencode/ocx.jsonc || echo '{"registries":{"kdco":{"url":"http://localhost:8787"}}}' > .opencode/ocx.jsonc
  ```
- [x] **Command:** `$OCX_BIN migrate --apply`
- [x] **Expected:** Creates `.ocx/receipt.jsonc` and backs up lock file to `.bak` (or `.bak.N` if `.bak` already exists)
- [x] **Verify:**
  ```bash
  test -f .ocx/receipt.jsonc && echo "OK: receipt.jsonc created" || echo "FAIL: receipt.jsonc missing"
  ls .opencode/ocx.lock.bak* 2>/dev/null && echo "OK: lock backup exists" || echo "FAIL: lock backup missing"
  ```
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24):** PASS — `$OCX_BIN migrate --apply` created `.ocx/receipt.jsonc`, backed up lock to `.opencode/ocx.lock.bak`, and exited `0`.
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

### 15.3 Rerun Is Safe (Already Migrated)

- [x] **Setup:** Project already migrated (Section 15.2 completed)
- [x] **Command:** `$OCX_BIN migrate --apply`
- [x] **Expected:** Prints "Already migrated to receipt format (.ocx/receipt.jsonc)." and exits 0 without modifying files
- [x] **Verify:**
  ```bash
  cat .ocx/receipt.jsonc  # Should be unchanged from 15.2
  ```
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24):** PASS — rerunning `$OCX_BIN migrate --apply` printed `Already migrated to receipt format (.ocx/receipt.jsonc).`, exited `0`, and left `.ocx/receipt.jsonc` unchanged.
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

### 15.4 Global Preview Mode (No Writes)

- [x] **Setup:** Global config with legacy `ocx.lock` and at least one profile with its own legacy `ocx.lock`
  ```bash
  $OCX_BIN init --global 2>/dev/null || true
  # Global root legacy lock
  cat > $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/ocx.lock << 'EOF'
  {"lockVersion":1,"installed":{"kdco/researcher":{"registry":"kdco","version":"1.0.0","hash":"abc123","files":[".opencode/agents/researcher.md"],"installedAt":"2025-06-01T00:00:00.000Z"}}}
  EOF
  echo '{"registries":{"kdco":{"url":"http://localhost:8787"}}}' > $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/ocx.jsonc
  # Profile legacy lock (work profile)
  $OCX_BIN profile rm work --global 2>/dev/null || true
  $OCX_BIN profile add work --global
  cat > $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/ocx.lock << 'EOF'
  {"lockVersion":1,"installed":{"kdco/notify":{"registry":"kdco","version":"0.5.0","hash":"def456","files":[".opencode/skills/notify/SKILL.md"],"installedAt":"2025-07-01T00:00:00.000Z"}}}
  EOF
  # Required for deterministic preview resolution: registry alias in profile config
  echo '{"registries":{"kdco":{"url":"http://localhost:8787"}}}' > $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/ocx.jsonc
  ```
- [x] **Command:** `$OCX_BIN migrate --global 2>&1 | tee /tmp/ocx-15.4-global-preview.log`
- [x] **Expected:** Prints migration preview for global root and work profile, with no parse warnings, and does not modify any files.
- [x] **Verify:**
  ```bash
  cat /tmp/ocx-15.4-global-preview.log | grep -q " root: " && echo "OK: global root included in preview" || echo "FAIL: global root missing from preview"
  cat /tmp/ocx-15.4-global-preview.log | grep -q "profile:work" && echo "OK: work profile included in preview" || echo "FAIL: work profile missing from preview"
  cat /tmp/ocx-15.4-global-preview.log | grep -q "Could not parse lock/config" && echo "FAIL: parse warning present" || echo "OK: no parse warning"
  test -f $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/ocx.lock && echo "OK: global lock unchanged" || echo "FAIL: lock file missing"
  test ! -f $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/.ocx/receipt.jsonc && echo "OK: No global receipt created" || echo "FAIL: receipt.jsonc should not exist yet"
  test -f $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/ocx.lock && echo "OK: profile lock unchanged" || echo "FAIL: profile lock missing"
  test ! -f $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/.ocx/receipt.jsonc && echo "OK: No profile receipt created" || echo "FAIL: profile receipt should not exist yet"
  ```
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-26):** PASS — with `work` profile registry mapping present in `profiles/work/ocx.jsonc`, preview included `profile:work` migration output, emitted no parse warning, made no writes, and exited `0`.
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-26_

### 15.5 Global Apply Migration (Root + Profile Fan-Out)

- [x] **Setup:** Global config with legacy `ocx.lock`, a registry entry containing deprecated `version` field, and one profile with its own legacy lock
  ```bash
  $OCX_BIN init --global 2>/dev/null || true
  # Global root legacy lock
  cat > $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/ocx.lock << 'EOF'
  {"lockVersion":1,"installed":{"kdco/researcher":{"registry":"kdco","version":"1.0.0","hash":"abc123","files":[".opencode/agents/researcher.md"],"installedAt":"2025-06-01T00:00:00.000Z"}}}
  EOF
  # Add deprecated registries.*.version field to trigger normalization
  echo '{"registries":{"kdco":{"url":"http://localhost:8787","version":"latest"}}}' > $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/ocx.jsonc
  # Profile legacy lock (work profile)
  $OCX_BIN profile rm work --global 2>/dev/null || true
  $OCX_BIN profile add work --global
  cat > $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/ocx.lock << 'EOF'
  {"lockVersion":1,"installed":{"kdco/notify":{"registry":"kdco","version":"0.5.0","hash":"def456","files":[".opencode/skills/notify/SKILL.md"],"installedAt":"2025-07-01T00:00:00.000Z"}}}
  EOF
  echo '{"registries":{"kdco":{"url":"http://localhost:8787","version":"latest"}}}' > $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/ocx.jsonc
  ```
- [x] **Command:** `$OCX_BIN migrate --global --apply`
- [x] **Expected:** Migrates global root first, then work profile. For each target: creates `.ocx/receipt.jsonc`, backs up lock to `.bak` (or `.bak.N`), and removes deprecated `registries.*.version` fields. Per-target summary printed.
- [x] **Verify:**
  ```bash
  # Global root
  test -f $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/.ocx/receipt.jsonc && echo "OK: global receipt created" || echo "FAIL: global receipt missing"
  ls $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/ocx.lock.bak* 2>/dev/null && echo "OK: global lock backup exists" || echo "FAIL: global lock backup missing"
  cat $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/ocx.jsonc | grep -q '"version"' && echo "FAIL: deprecated version field still present" || echo "OK: version field removed"
  # Work profile
  test -f $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/.ocx/receipt.jsonc && echo "OK: profile receipt created" || echo "FAIL: profile receipt missing"
  ls $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/ocx.lock.bak* 2>/dev/null && echo "OK: profile lock backup exists" || echo "FAIL: profile lock backup missing"
  cat $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/ocx.jsonc | grep -q '"version"' && echo "FAIL: profile version field still present" || echo "OK: profile version field removed"
  ```
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24):** PASS — `$OCX_BIN migrate --global --apply` migrated root and `work`, created both receipts and lock backups, removed deprecated `registries.*.version`, and exited `0`.
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

### 15.6 Global Rerun Is Safe (Already Migrated)

- [x] **Setup:** Global config and profile already migrated (Section 15.5 completed)
- [x] **Command:** `$OCX_BIN migrate --global --apply`
- [x] **Expected:** Prints already-migrated message for each target (global root and work profile) and exits 0 without modifying files
- [x] **Verify:**
  ```bash
  cat $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/.ocx/receipt.jsonc  # Should be unchanged from 15.5
  cat $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/ocx.jsonc  # Should be unchanged from 15.5
  cat $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/work/.ocx/receipt.jsonc  # Should be unchanged from 15.5
  ```
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24):** PASS — rerunning `$OCX_BIN migrate --global --apply` reported all targets already up to date, exited `0`, and receipt/config hashes remained unchanged.
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

### 15.7 Global Apply Continues on Partial Failure

- [x] **Setup:** Global root already migrated; one profile is migratable and one profile is intentionally invalid
  ```bash
  # Ensure global root is already migrated (receipt exists, no legacy lock)
  # Passing profile: has legacy lock + matching registry mapping
  $OCX_BIN profile rm passing --global 2>/dev/null || true
  $OCX_BIN profile add passing --global
  cat > $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/passing/ocx.lock << 'EOF'
  {"lockVersion":1,"installed":{"kdco/notify":{"registry":"kdco","version":"0.5.0","hash":"def456","files":[".opencode/skills/notify/SKILL.md"],"installedAt":"2025-07-01T00:00:00.000Z"}}}
  EOF
  echo '{"registries":{"kdco":{"url":"http://localhost:8787"}}}' > $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/passing/ocx.jsonc
  # Failing profile: legacy lock references kdco but ocx.jsonc omits kdco mapping
  $OCX_BIN profile rm failing --global 2>/dev/null || true
  $OCX_BIN profile add failing --global
  cat > $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/failing/ocx.lock << 'EOF'
  {"lockVersion":1,"installed":{"kdco/workspace":{"registry":"kdco","version":"1.0.0","hash":"bad789","files":[".opencode/workspace.md"],"installedAt":"2025-08-01T00:00:00.000Z"}}}
  EOF
  echo '{"registries":{}}' > $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/failing/ocx.jsonc
  ```
- [x] **Command:** `$OCX_BIN migrate --global --apply`
- [x] **Expected:** Global root reports already migrated, `passing` migrates successfully, `failing` reports registry-mapping error, and command exits non-zero after processing all targets.
- [x] **Verify:**
  ```bash
  test -f $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/passing/.ocx/receipt.jsonc && echo "OK: passing profile receipt created" || echo "FAIL: passing profile receipt missing"
  ls $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/passing/ocx.lock.bak* 2>/dev/null && echo "OK: passing profile lock backup exists" || echo "FAIL: passing profile lock backup missing"
  test ! -f $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/failing/.ocx/receipt.jsonc && echo "OK: failing profile did not migrate" || echo "FAIL: failing profile receipt should not exist"
  test ! -f $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/opencode/profiles/failing/ocx.lock.bak && echo "OK: failing profile lock not backed up" || echo "FAIL: failing profile lock backup should not exist"
  ```
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24):** FAIL — `$OCX_BIN migrate --global --apply` failed for `profile:failing` with `Registry "kdco" referenced in lock key "kdco/workspace" is not configured in ocx.jsonc. Add it before migrating.` (exit `1`); no receipt or `.bak` was created for that profile.
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24, checkpoint resume):** BLOCKED — setup was blocked before rerunning migration: `$OCX_BIN` was unset in the current shell, so `$OCX_BIN profile ...` expanded to `profile` (`command not found`) and profile config writes targeted `/opencode/...` (`no such file or directory`).
- [x] **Run result (2026-02-24, explicit env bootstrap retry):** PASS — after exporting `OCX_REPO`, `OCX_BIN`, and `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` in the same shell, setup completed and `$OCX_BIN migrate --global --apply` behaved as expected: `profile:passing` migrated, `profile:failing` reported the expected missing-registry error, exited `1`, and verification checks passed.
- [x] **Last tested:** _v2.0.0 on 2026-02-24_

### Platform-Specific Behavior

- **macOS**: Primary testing platform
- **Linux**: Most commands identical to macOS
- **Windows**: Not covered by this document (see Windows-specific testing guide)

### Test Environment Best Practices

1. Always use `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` for isolation
2. Clean up between sections to avoid state pollution
3. Use development build from workspace (not installed version)
4. Test with real registries when possible for integration validation
5. Document any test failures or unexpected behavior immediately

### Contributing Test Cases

When adding new test cases:

1. Follow existing format (Setup, Command, Expected, Verify)
2. Include checkbox for QA tracking
3. Add "Last tested" placeholder
4. Reference source documentation (file + line numbers)
5. Update Section 16 verification checklist
6. Update Section 17 sync checklist with cross-references

### Exit Codes Reference

| Code | Name       | Examples |
|------|------------|----------|
| 0    | Success    | Successful operations |
| 1    | General    | Unspecified errors |
| 6    | Conflict   | Registry/profile already exists, file conflicts |
