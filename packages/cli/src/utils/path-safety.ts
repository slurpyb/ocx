/**
 * Path Safety Utilities
 *
 * Two-layer protection against path traversal attacks:
 * 1. Schema validation at parse boundary (rejects malicious patterns)
 * 2. Runtime containment before file writes (verifies resolved paths)
 *
 * Following the 5 Laws:
 * - Parse at boundary: safeRelativePathSchema validates input structure
 * - Fail fast: assertPathInside throws immediately on escape attempts
 * - Intentional naming: isPathInside/assertPathInside are self-documenting
